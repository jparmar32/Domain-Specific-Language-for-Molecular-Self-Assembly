# Tile-Templates
This repository contains code for a domain specific language that will help implement theoretical models in the field of Molecular Self Assembly. Additionally I intend to include a graphical user interface linked with the domain-specific language in order to provide users with an intuitive method of designing tile sets. Overall, I expect that this software will allow for the design of complex tile systems more quickly and with fewer errors.
