# Tile-Templates
This repository contains code for a domain specific language that will help implement complex theoretical models in the field of Molecular Self Assembly. Additionally I intend to include a graphical user interface linked with the domain-specific language in order to provide users with an intuitive method of designing tile sets. By providing a faster and more error-free method to implement tile sets, I expect that this software will allow for the design of complex tile systems that have not been implemented before.
